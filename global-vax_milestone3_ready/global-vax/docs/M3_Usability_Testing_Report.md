- Tasks: navigation to MCV2; filters 2019–2024; zero-dose reduction; indicator definitions & revision year; download + source/last update
- Post-test survey (SUS + 3 open-ended questions)

## 2. Findings (Summary)

|---|---|---|---|
| Nav to MCV2 | Success; minor discoverability issue | “Nav label could stand out more” | Low |
| Filters | Worked; clarity improved with labels | “Year labels helpful; tooltips nice” | Medium |
| Zero-dose | Worked; needed contrasting colours | “Lines look similar at first” | Medium |
| Definitions | Found; moved closer to chart | “Good to have definitions nearby” | Medium |
| Download/Source | Success | “Clear where to click + provenance” | Low |

## 3. Changes Implemented
- Increased nav contrast and active-state
- Added year labels and tooltips to filter controls
- High-contrast colour palette for lines/bars
- Moved definitions beside chart; added revision year + last update in page
- Keyboard focus styles; alt text

## 4. Evidence
- _Include screenshots here (before/after)_
- _Attach raw survey responses in `/docs/surveys/`_

## 5. Reflection
Iterative tweaks based on short tests significantly improved findability and comprehension of indicators and trends. Clearer metadata placement increased trust in the data.
